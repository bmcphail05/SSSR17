# Introduction

Numerous research studies have explored the effects of religion on socioeconomic status and social inequality; however, the bulk of this work has been limited to the study of denominations in the United States.

- the relative position of the major religious categories the socioeconomic index; the scale indicates the number of standard deviation units above or below the national mean score on the socioeconomic index
- the social positions of religious groups in the US have persisted over time
- Christian Smith and Robert Faris have found similar results and concluded that socioeconomic inequality in the religious system of the US is very stable.
- These studies demonstrate that religion in the US is stratified by socioeconomic measures such as income, education, and occupational status.

# Theory
How do we explain the emergence of a social hierarchy of religious groups?

Fair shares theory highlights the divisive role of religious groups themselves in producing and sustaining social inequality. Arguing from a Weberian social conflict framework, Davidson and Pyle [-@davidson2006; -@davidson2008] claim that religion--just like race, class, or gender--is a basis for unequal access to power, privilege, and prestige. Under the necessary conditions of religious prejudice, competition, and differential power, the religious group on top aims to preserve its advantages, and inequalities become semi-permanent in the form of religious stratification [@pyle2003]. Studies in the United States have found significant effects of religion on access to power, privilege, and prestige [@keister2003; @pyle2006].

But, little attention has been paid to the socioeconomic differences between religious groups in other nations. Today, I want to look at the situation in China.

Since the end of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) in China, religion has make a remarkable comeback. The Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) religious ban nearly eradicated religion from Chinese society, but today 20% of the population now claims to be religious.


Over the same period, China has boasted unprecedented rates of economic growth, which has been accompanied by the rapid increase of income inequality. In less than three decades, the Gini coefficient has nearly doubled from 0.30 in 1980 to 0.55 in 2012 [@xie2014]. Social classes are becoming more distinct. Although researchers have used government policy, geographic location, education, and race/ethnicity to explain the burgeoning social inequality [@li2013; @xie2014; @wang2014], the role of religion has yet to be considered.

And that's why my project aims to do.

In addition to socioeconomic inequality, contemporary Chinese society appears to have the necessary conditions for religious stratification to emerge: prejudice, competition, and differential power. Communist ideology and policies has promoted prejudices against religion, regulated religion in ways that have created a shortage of religious suppliers and competition in the religious marketplace [@yang2011], and also consolidated power in the hands of the militantly atheist CCP. Based on these realities, atheism we would expect atheism to sit atop a religious stratification structure in China.

# Research Questions/Hypotheses

The aim of this study is to examine the socioeconomic differences among China's religious groups to determine whether or not atheism enjoys greater social and economic privilege in contemporary Chinese society. For this particular analysis, I am asking the question: is there a "religion penalty" in China whereby the income of religious believers is lower than that of atheists?

Based on fair shares theory and the political preference of atheism in China, I have hypothesized that religious affiliation will be negatively associated with income. In other words, individuals who identify as being religious will have lower annual incomes than atheists, even when accounting for the influence of gender, education, political affiliation (i.e., Communist Party Membership), and location.

# Methods and Data

To answer this question, I use data from the 2007 Spiritual Life Study of Chinese Residents (SLSC), a national multi-stage probability sample (N = 7,021) of Chinese citizens (above 16 years of age) in mainland China. As the most comprehensive survey of Chinese religion to date, the SLSC collected extensive data on the religious beliefs, practices, and affiliations of the Chinese people. The resulting sample size for this study is N = 4,686.

Using OLS regression, I estimate the effect of religion on annual personal income.

I choose to measure religiosity in several different ways. This is an extremely important decision, which is also a notoriously difficult thing to do. China presents a particularly interesting case, which complicates my decision her. Religion in the Chinese context stresses ritual and practice more so than it does beliefs or identity, so on the one hand it makes sense to capture religiosity in terms of religious practice. However, given the nature of my particular research question and the social processes that I think may be at work, there is an assumption that an individual's religious identity is at least semi-public. With this in mind, I have chosen to test several models with slightly different measures of religion.  

In my first model, I use an item from the survey that simply asks respondents if they have religious belief (y/n). In my second model, I use indicator variables for the respondents' religious affiliation. In the third model, I use more than 20 different survey items to create an indicator variable that I call Strict Atheism. In order to be a strict atheist, a respondent cannot answer in the affirmative for any item asking about religious belief, religious practice, or religious affiliation. Because there will be many respondents who say they don't believe, who don't affiliate, but who do religious practices, I want to test whether or not religious practice makes a difference.

I repeat these three regression analyses and include gender, college degree, party membership, and location (urban/rural) as controls.  What I am reporting here are the models that include these control variables.

# Conclusion
-Speculation
-Not enough time. Modern China is still very young, and remains quite dynamic. Patterns haven't had time to develop.
-Although the Party makes all the decisions, it doesn't necessarily provide benefits that are only for atheists.  
-Although the state continues to have a heavy hand in the economy, the market reforms of the early 1980s opened the economy up to a free market system. Now there are multiple ways ("paths") to be successful ("red, black, and green" [@cite]).
-The direction of the effect may be the opposite of what I have presented here. Rather than religion influencing one's SES, perhaps one's SES influences one's religion (which I have plans for a future project).
